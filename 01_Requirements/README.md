# INTRODUCTION :
Now-days everyone is looking for automation and advancements in all the sectors.  Most of these days technology is growing and peoples are expecting more technology systems. The Vehicle Seat Heat Monitoring System is capable of maintaining of heat in the vehicles seats. In European countries, the temperature is very low and any electronic designer should make sure that his equipment should work efficiently in that whether. In our project, the sensor will sense the driver has been sit or not and if the driver sit then he need to set the temperature accordingly. Based on that our controller will be set the heater to required temperature. The Heater will generate the heat and a LCD display will show requested the temperature. In our project we have used ATmega328 microcontroller along with temperature sensor, Push button, Heat generator, LED and LCD diplay,etc.The main aim of the project is to check wheather a person is seating in seat or not, by using the sensors.
# FEATURES : 
 * Sences that if the person is on seat or not.
 * Driver or Passenger has the access to modify the temperature in the vehicle.
 * Heat would generate according to the driver's request.
 * Reliable in using.
 * Can be replacabe if any external or internal damages are taken place.
 * Low cost and robust system.
 * Modular Approach.
  
# SWOT Analysis:
   
   ## STRENGTH:
   * User Friendly.
   * Easy to alter the temperature inside the vehicles.
   * Modular Approach.
   ## WEAKNESS:
   * It can't be used in the high temperatured areas.
   ## OPPORTUNITIES:
   * We can change the requirements of dectecting temperature by replacing with the air conditioners.
   * We can also implement it by using heater and AC.
   ## THREATS:  
   * It is not suitable in high temperature.
